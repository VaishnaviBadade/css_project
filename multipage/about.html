    <h1 class="about-head">About Music</h1>
    <p class="about-text">
        Music is the art of arranging sound.[1][2] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human
        societies.[citation needed]

        Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and
        orchestra performance, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or
        video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of
        radios and smartphones.

        Music may be defined with styles that emphasize, de-emphasize, or omit common elements of organized sound, such
        as rhythm, volume and pitch. Rhythm may be specified with tempos, sometimes organized using meters, and often
        coordinating the variation and juxtaposition of pitch. Individual sounds possess timbres or texture, which
        heavily contribute to the music's overall character. The relationships and divisions between genres are inexact
        and sometimes hotly contested, as in taxonomy. The mere existence or legitimacy of a genre may be a topic of
        controversy. It is sometimes more valuable to categorize music by era, scene, intent, or artistic inspiration.

        Individual periods of music are separated into pieces, which can be categorized into numerous traditions, such
        as songs, tracks, symphonies, or so forth. Pieces may be composed and performed using a vast range of
        instruments, including the human voice. There are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces, pieces that
        combine singing and instruments, pieces with no sound, randomly generated pieces, and even pieces merely
        specifying an environment with no further sonic organization.

        In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in
        Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and
        using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a
        changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting
        at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or agglomerated electronically from
        many performances.

        Music often plays a key role in social activities (such as dancing, karaoke singing, and attending concerts),
        religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, graduation and marriage celebrations, and cultural activities
        such as community choirs. It can be a hobby or a profession, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra or a
        local funk band hired for parties. The music industry includes songwriters, performers (including orchestra,
        jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), sound engineers, producers, tour organizers,
        distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are
        assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.

        Like visual art and literature, music is widely created, appreciated, academically studied and criticized, and
        has been for thousands of years. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music in two parts: melodies, as
        tones ordered "horizontally", and harmonies as tones ordered "vertically".[citation needed] 20th-century
        composer John Cage believed any sound was music, asserting "There is no noise, only sound
